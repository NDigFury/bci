        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <img src="chip.png" alt="brain chip" style="width:1000px;height:600px;">
        <p>For many years the long standing of BCI goes into two categories:</p>
        <li>Non-invasive or EEG </li>
        <li>Surgical installed adapter and reciever</li>
        <p>These two features listen to the brain and do not have a impluse to return information. 
        The brain interaction only sends the information to the device and not the other way around.
        I am currently a research assistant for the multimedia augmented reailty and virtual reality lab.
        This topic is what I am doing my research paper on.

        <h2>Various Companies</h2>
        <p>Wearable EEG just read the impluses that are detectible on the surface of the scalp.
            Currently there are various companies out there attempting to progress the science. 
        </p>
        <h3>Neuralink</h3>
        <p>a company owned by Elon Musk, creates medical applications via bluetooth to send a signal from the 
            brain to different devices like a computer, phone, keyboard, or actuator. This company currently threads
            into the brain attempting to help those with memory loss, hearing loss, blindness, and other medical conditions.
        </p>
        <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a>
        <h3>Neurable</h3>
        <p>which is a company that focuses on BCI improvements, created the first VR game that was completely controlled
            by an EEG. They have since created the &rsquo;smart headphones&rsquo; which listens to the brain activity on if the track should be
            skipped, stopped, louder, softer... 
        </p>
        <a href="https://neurable.com/">Neurable</a>
        <h3>Kernal</h3>
        <p>created the first infrared scanning ssytem to create brain imaging from one wearable. </p>
        <a href="https://www.kernel.com/">Kernal</a>
        <p>Yet, in my opinion we haven&rsquo;t gone far enough with BCI technology. I think the progress has almost halted. As continuing with
            EEG technology will crutch the community into only listening to the brain and not responding.
            Currently if we wanted to respond to the brain&rsquo;s output we would have to have an invasive surgery and it
            wouldn&rsquo;t be up to my standards.
        </p>
        <p>My hope would be we get to a place where if you wanted to understand another language, without knowing it, you could.
            Just by listening the device would translate into your language. Like Neuralink having the ability to text, watch videos,
            or call friends without a device in hand is great. Yet, what if we can &rsquo;hear&rsquo; the response.
            We can &rsquo;see&rsquo; the video playing. In my opinion Neuralink is the closest yet, the threading would concern me.
